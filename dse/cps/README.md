# VIATRA-DSE CPS example

This cyber-physical system configuration example created solely for the design space exploration component of the VIATRA project.

Although it has similarities to the EMF-IncQuery CPS example, which is not eclipse.org conform yet, this model and codebase is created by András Szabolcs Nagy, and is the very same model used in the publication "*Hani Abdeen, Dániel Varró, Houari Sahraoui, András Szabolcs Nagy, Ábel Hegedüs, Ákos Horváth, and Csaba Debreceni: Multi-Objective Optimization in Rule-Based Design Space Exploration*" presented at the ASE2014 conference.
